## Summary

Drawback

The drawback of the webpage is that the launch page displayed all the sightings at once therefore making the page unnecessarily long to view and does not encourage the use of the filter function.

Recommendation
1.	Set up the page to display top 5 sightings which will increase userâ€™s curiosity to use the filter search function.
2.	Add a dropdown filter selection to allow user to view only the information they want to view.
