# UFOs

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to use JavaScript, html, D3 and css style to build a dynamic website to publish articles about UFOs in a webpage.  The website will be displaying tabular data of UFO sightings with filters and button clicks to enhance user experience.


## Results

The website has a dynamic display UFO sighting in a tabular form with the ability to filter and search by variety of criteria. One can filter by City, State, Shape or by Date.  



## Summary

Drawback

The drawback of the webpage is that the launch page displayed all the sightings at once therefore making the page unnecessarily long to view and does not encourage the use of the filter function.

Recommendation
1.	Set up the page to display top 5 sightings which will increase userâ€™s curiosity to use the filter search function.
2.	Add a dropdown filter selection to allow user to view only the information they want to view.
